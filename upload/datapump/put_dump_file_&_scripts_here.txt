Any shell (.sh) or SQL (.sql) scripts you put in this directory
will be copied and executed by running import dump script (/home/oracle/datapump/import.sh). Only shell and SQL scripts will be executed; all
other files will be ignored.  These scripts are completely
optional.

Shell scripts will be executed as oracle user (su -l oracle -c),
SQL scripts will be executed as SYS.  

To run scripts in a specific order, prefix the file names with a
number, e.g., 01_shellscript.sh, 02_tablespaces.sql,
03_shellscript2.sh, etc.
